        flexibility attribute:

        Make the item fluid so that it absorbs any extra space in its
        container or shrinks when there is less space. 
        
        Allowed values are:
        - auto (columns grow or shrink equally as space allows),
        - shrink (columns shrink equally as space decreases),
        - no-shrink (columns don't shrink as space reduces),
        - grow (columns grow equally as space increases),
        - no-grow (columns don't grow as space increases),
        - no-flex (columns don't grow or shrink as space changes).

        Use a comma-separated value for multiple options, such as 'auto, no-shrink'.
